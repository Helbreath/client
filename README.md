## Helbreath Xtreme Client
This is the client that powers Helbreath Xtreme. This client has been in development since approximately ~2008. Work on it happened on and off over the years but it is the culmination of most of what I've done with Helbreath so far. It's missing a lot of commit history that was a lot of the truly revolutionary parts, but from 2017 and on it's all here.

For the sake of going back to my origins, this client will remain fully opensource so long as I'm working on Helbreath. Certain parts will not be open. Things like pak encryption keys, server encryption keys, the obvious stuff. You can generate your own and rebuild everything. Any keys contained within this project are outdated and/or expired. I did not take the time to clean every line of code.
